**Executive summary**

In this project, we implement a regression model to predict houses' price. The dataset used in the boston_housing dataset loaded from keras.datasets. We trained the model for two different number of epochs (100 and 500). Since the training set is relatively small (404,), we use the k-fold method in the validation process.
